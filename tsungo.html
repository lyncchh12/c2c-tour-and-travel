    <h1>tsungo lake</h1>
    <p>Tsomgo Lake, also known as Changu Lake, is a popular tourist destination in Sikkim, India. Located at an altitude of 12,400 feet above sea level, Tsomgo Lake is surrounded by snow-capped mountains and is considered one of the most beautiful high-altitude lakes in India. The lake's crystal clear waters reflect the stunning surrounding scenery, making it a photographer's paradise. Tsomgo Lake is also considered sacred by the local Sikkimese people, and visitors can witness traditional rituals performed on the lake's banks. The lake is only accessible during certain months of the year and requires a permit from the local authorities, but it is well worth the effort to visit this breathtaking natural wonder.</p>
